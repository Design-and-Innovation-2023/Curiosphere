# Curiosphere: Where Education Comes Alive!

This is the website to demonstrate our Overseas Immersion Programme (OIP) 2023 project with the University of Glasgow (UoG) making use of the Curio platform and to share our ideation, process and reflections throughout the project.

## Project Title
Designing computing science activities using Curio platform

## Problem Statement
To foster the development of a computational mindset among pre-university students with prior or no prior experience, we get to make use of the Curio platform and robot to design interesting activities for students to learn about computing science at University of Glasgow. The objective is to provide the students with an engaging learning experience that encourages the cultivation of computational thinking skills and interest in the realm of computing science.

## Project Description
A quiz system using Curio robots allowing students to engage in an interactive learning experience regarding computing science. In a team of 3 students and a Curio robot, 2 teams compete in a battle activity. The 2 robots start at opposite ends of the playing area. Correct answers make the robot move towards the goal, while incorrect answers make it move backward. The team whose robot crosses the middle line or goes further from the starting point is the victor.
